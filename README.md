# loudly-task

This app was created by Jamie Stuart as an interview project for the front-end dev team at Loudly. 

Start the app with npm start or yarn start. 

The app includes very simple testing to make sure the app loads.

The following bugs and questions came up:

1) Could not get Like Count to persist because could not access the server to POST the data. Would love to pair with someone on this to see what I did wrong.

2) Did not use Typescript or Flow because I am not familiar with either and didn't have enough time to commit to learning one. Whichever is more useful for the environment at Loudly, I will gladly spend a weekend or evening learning! I added PropTypes on my parent component instead of Typescript/Flow. 

3) I was unsure of best company practices (and best practices in general) for Git because this is my first time working in a collaborative dev environment. I look forward to learning more! 

Please get back to me with any questions jstuart@loudly.com ! 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
